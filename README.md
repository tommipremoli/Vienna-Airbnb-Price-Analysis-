# Vienna Airbnb Price Analysis

This group project analyzes Airbnb listings in Vienna, focusing on understanding price determinants and neighborhood dynamics through advanced statistical techniques. The study leverages data from insideairbnb.com, including key features like price, neighborhood, amenities, and distance to points of interest.

The analysis applies:

- Robust Regression to identify significant predictors while handling outliers.
- Bootstrapping to ensure model reliability.
- Random Mixed Models to explore neighborhood-specific effects and variability, highlighting how features like bathrooms influence prices differently across districts.
- Clustering Methods to group neighborhoods based on price patterns and characteristics, uncovering distinct market segments.
Key findings reveal that central districts, such as Innere Stadt, command higher prices due to proximity to landmarks and demand for comfort, while suburban areas show weaker influences of certain features. The project provides insights for optimizing property pricing and understanding spatial trends in Viennaâ€™s Airbnb market.
